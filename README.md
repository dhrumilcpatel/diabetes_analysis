The Diabetes Trends and Insights project is designed to analyze and visualize diabetes-related data using Power BI, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into diabetes patterns, risk factors, and demographic details. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the project helps stakeholders make informed decisions based on data. The data used in this project comes from reliable sources, including demographic details, medical history, and diabetes-related metrics. Key metrics analyzed include the prevalence of diabetes across different age groups, gender-wise distribution, regional trends, and risk factors associated with diabetes.

The dashboard comprises multiple pages, each focusing on different aspects of diabetes insights. The Overview Page provides a summary of key metrics related to diabetes prevalence and trends, utilizing bar charts, maps, and donut charts for clear and concise data depiction. The Demographics Page offers a detailed view of the demographic distribution of diabetes, including age-wise and disease-wise breakdowns. The Risk Factors Page analyzes various risk factors associated with diabetes, employing bar plots to identify correlations between metrics like Average Glucose and BMI. Users can interact with the dashboard by downloading and opening the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop, where they can explore visualizations and filter data using slicers.

The project highlights significant findings, such as the increasing trend of diabetes over the years and the identification of specific age groups and regions with higher prevalence. Gender-wise analysis shows disparities in diabetes prevalence among males and females, while age-wise distribution indicates higher risk in older age groups. Future enhancements for the project include incorporating more data sources to provide a comprehensive view, implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics, integrating real-time data sources for up-to-date insights, and collecting user feedback to improve the dashboardâ€™s usability and accuracy.
